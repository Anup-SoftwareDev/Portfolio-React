More specifically what drives me is a desire to produce high Quality Websites that play a part in {replaceTextBold('enhancing')} your {replaceTextBold('business/brand')} .
                    <br/><br /> Currently I make use of {replaceTextBold('React')} and {replaceTextBold('Ruby-on-Rails')} to program my Websites.

                    Well Designed,
                    Efficiently Coded,
                    Documented Appropriately and
